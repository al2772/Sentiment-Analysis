# Sentiment-Analysis

Uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for text processing and scikit-learn library for machine learning. It assumes you already have a labeled dataset in a CSV file where each row contains a text sample and its corresponding sentiment label.

Make sure to replace 'sentiment_data.csv' with the path to your labeled dataset file. The sentiment labels in the dataset should be encoded as 0 (negative), 1 (neutral), and 2 (positive).

Remember to install the required libraries (NLTK and scikit-learn) using pip install nltk scikit-learn before running the code.

This code provides a clean and readable implementation of the sentiment analysis project, covering data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and sentiment analysis on user input.

A sample of 'sentiment_data.csv' is given.
